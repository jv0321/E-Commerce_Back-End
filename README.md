# Usage
To utilize this application, users must first ensure that Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Insomnia are installed on their system. Upon cloning the repository, users need to execute "npm i" to install necessary dependencies. Subsequently, users must input their PostgreSQL credentials in a .env file, and then access PostgreSQL in their terminal to execute "\i ./db/schema.sql" before exiting. Users should then proceed with "npm run seed" followed by "npm run dev". Afterwards, using Insomnia, users can launch the application and construct HTTP requests, utilizing provided images as reference, to commence managing their products. Adding and updating functionality requires sending requests with JSON by selecting the "Body" tab and choosing "JSON" from the dropdown menu.
